Created a companion android application to an IoT device in collaboration with Cisco's thinqQbator program.
My team-mate and I created an IoT device where one could detect an accident and then send the location of the driver to the specified emergency contacts.
This repo consists of the Java Android Application constructed for the same.
It utilises the user phone's GPS & SMS capabilities and links with the real-time database, Firebase.
